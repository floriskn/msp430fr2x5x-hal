//! Information Memory.
//! [INFO_MEM_SIZE] bytes of non-volatile memory (information FRAM: SLASEC4D Table 6-4, p. 65; SLASE59F
//! Table 6-23, p. 61; SLASEO7C Table 9-31, p. 73; SLASEE4C Table 6-19, p. 62).
//!
//! A single instance of [InfoMemory] is returned by [`Pmm::new()`](crate::pmm::Pmm::new()).
//!
//! Because the information memory has write protection, access is managed via a write method (SYSCFG0.DFWP,
//! SLAU445I 1.9.3, p. 45).
//!
//! For convenience there is also a method [`InfoMemory::into_unprotected()`] that disables write protection
//! and returns the infomation memory directly as an array instead.
